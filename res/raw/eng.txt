"ColorText"="                Tie's color.**The first tie in your wardrobe must be solid, of the colour that suits you the most. It should be taken into account that a traditional red tie is not only a nice refreshing, but also is considered to be a sign of success and power. The solid tie can emphasize a good colour matching of suits and shirts. The only danger of a solid tie is that it's a bore. So do not be obsessed with such ones, and finally the most important thing. **In the wardrobe of every man must necessarily be a tie that most clearly reflects the individuality of its owner. This piece of cloth on the neck will be truthfully inform all others: "And here is he, who I really am". **Principles of selection are a set of fixed rules after the reading which you can avoid many problems. Suit is the basis of man's attire. Its colour, cut, style and appearance serve the goal that you want to achieve. **The colour of your shirt is determined by the situation, and the tie must correspond to both the suit and shirt. The easiest way to combine suit, shirt and tie is to use those of  plain fabrics, so without much difficulty the right choice will be made . This will create a discreet, but elegant style, because all the three components of the ensemble will  comprise plain fabrics.****"
"PictureText"="                Tie's picture.**Try to combine subtle and bold patterns because two imperceptible drawing close look worn after being washed. Two brave drawing close look defiant. **The shirt with little narrow stripes looks best with a tie of uniform stripes,  which rapport is wider. Stick to a one-way pattern. So as a brave check and strip have certain direction, they are difficult to combine together, because they conflict with each other. **However, a faint stripe can be well combined with bold stripes, and the shirt with a little check can be well combined with a bold, plaid tie, since the direction of the line is repeated. Ties, whose figures represent a rare geometry of a floral pattern or club ties do match the  tartan fabrics. Good combinations can be composed of two fabrics whose patterns are a bold and a subtle, of different rapport: large and small... don't be afraid to experiment. Be afraid to experiment badly. ****"
"ShapeText"="                Tie's shape.**The correct width of tie is always determined by the lapels of your jacket.  **A man with narrow shoulders has less space of chest to lay out the lapels; therefore, more narrow lapels determine the width of the tie that will match the outfit. On the contrary, a broad-shouldered man requires more extensive lapels and hence a more wide tie. **The secret of an aesthetically acceptable tie lies in getting the knot set so that it could slot into an inverted V notch, formed by contracting sides of the collar. To fix it better, you should form the notch or a reverse fold under the middle of your knot. If you do not perform the procedure of formation, trying to get the knot, it will not have the necessary energy to provocatively peek out from under the collar. Instead of looking out distinctly and elegantly, it will hang as a dead fish, reducing the generosity of the composition. With the high-society  dicky-tie (plastron, its description available in the extended application), nicely enshrined right under the collar and closing the hiatus below the top of the V-angle, forming a perfect line and invoking the vision of its owner as a person, who does command his own lifestyle. **Pay attention to the usefulness of the tie with a large pattern in the construction of many harmonious compositions consisting of a number of drawings. The ensembles with several patterns often require at least one generously dimensioned design for the right balance, and the more eye-catching ties are necessary for the creation of such an aesthetic consent. Men, in the same way that women, are always interested in whether the width of a tie should be more or less. However, the answer is not in the world of fashion, but in the realm of personal architecture.****"
"CareText"="                Tie's care.**Maintenance Special care required by male ties comprises many reasons: men's tie is better not to wash and mustn't be ironed - it may lose the form. Dry cleaning can rescue it from the curse of being smeared with stains, and there is a simple way to eliminate the folds: gently wind the tie on her finger, take off and leave it hang for some time. **It is important to tie men's cravat and, moreover, every time it must be dissolved, it must be operated in the reverse order of how it was tied. Do not yield to the desire of just pulling the narrow end out of knot. Thus you can easily corrupt your tie even if it is of high quality. If your tie has lost its natural form, you should hang it on cloths hanger and leave intact for a couple of days. **Ties are best to store in special cabinets. You can also use the coat hanger for your ties, but at the same time try to avoid their contacting other garments. If you often have to go on business trips, it is better to buy a special flat case, in which you can place your shirts, ties, scarves and other accessories. **By following these simple rules, you will be able to save any of the elite ties in excellent condition for a long time. In most cases, on ties you can find the following tags containing information about the permitted methods of laundry, dry cleaning, drying and ironing: Product washing is not recommended. Iron at a temperature of no higher than 100 C. Can not be bleached with chlorinated substances. Removal of stains by kerosene or pure spirits ****"

"item1info"="The knot "Windsor" - the large, rounded, triangular - is sometimes ironically referred to as "Double Windsor". In our days this knot is generally chosen by leaders of different countries: Hugo Chavez, Vladimir Putin, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. **Despite the name of this knot, it was not actually created by the duke von Windsor, as is often assumed. In "Family album" the duke says that the desired effect is achieved, rather by manufactured specially for him tight tissues, rather than complex knots:The so-called «Windsor knot» a little later came to America. Perhaps, it happened during the war, when the knot was used in the attire of the military, and was eagerly adopted by american students. But I haven't anyway contributed to this knot. The knot that the Americans have given my name to, initially  was a double knot used for a narrow tie - sometimes it is also called "Slim Jim"."
